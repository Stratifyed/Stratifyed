#Class: Bioinformatics, Spring 2022
#Date Created: 03 February 2022

#Load seqinr package
library(seqinr)

#Read FASTA file into seqinr and save as object
hs_myo <- read.fasta(file = "",
  
#Set as.string = TRUE to print DNA sequence as string (otherwise, returned as single-character vectors and gets cut off at 10k bases)  
  as.string = TRUE)

#Print hs_myo to verify working code
hs_myo

#load spgs package
library(spgs)

#reverseComplement() can read vectors but ALSO objects if they are of class = "SeqFastadna"
#Run reverseComplement on human myostatin gene
reverseComplement(hs_myo)

#Reverse complement of human myostatin gene is now successfully printed
